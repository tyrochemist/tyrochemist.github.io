My research interests include the formation of nucleotides and nucleosides in the context of a prebiotic earth. Publications include the following:

- [One-Pot Formation of Pairing Proto-RNA Nucleotides](note/One-Pot-Formation-of-Pairing-Proto-Nucleotides.html)
- [A Plausible Prebiotic Path to Nucleosides: Ribosides and Related Aldosides Generated from Ribulose, Fructose, and Similar Abiotic Precursors
](note/Ketose-Sugars-and-Nucleoside-Formation.html)
- [Prebiotic Syntheses of Noncanonical Nucleosides and Nucleotides
](note/Prebiotic-Noncanonical-Nucleoside-Formation.html)
