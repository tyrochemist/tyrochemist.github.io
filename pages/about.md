I have been driven by my desire to understand life from first a biological, and then a chemical, perspective. Both within and outside of science, I believe that to be challenged in one's beliefs is to truly understand them, and I welcome open and honest discussion about any topic.

My nickname "Tyro" is a shortening of my first and last name, but I've come to learn that as a real word, "tyro" is of neoclassical origin, stemming from an alternate spelling of the latin word "tiro", meaning recruit or learner. I believe in the concept of [beginner's mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin) and strive to maintain such an attitude in my approach to learning about all topics, both those which are new to me and those with which I am familiar. Here, I will try to cultivate my own Tyrocinium, or place of learning, in all of my efforts.
