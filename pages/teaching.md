# Visiting Assistant Professor of Chemistry, Trinity University
I have taught two classes thus far at Trinity University, including Biochem I and Biochemistry Laboratory.

## Biochem I
I have taught Biochem I in a flipped-classroom style, utilizing some previously-created videos and some I made myself, in order to foster productive engagement during the class period. Complementing the standard Biochemical curriculum, I included an emphasis on 3D-molecular visualization as well as incorporating discussions about racism in science and medicine as provided by my co-teacher.

## Biochemistry Lab
I taught Biochemistry Laboratory collaboratively with a co-teacher, and provided students excellent opportunities to experience a variety of experimemtal techniques including FRET, circular dichroism, fluorescence spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, isoelectric focusing, SDS-PAGE, and column affinity chromatography.

## Advanced Chemical Principles
In this course, I encouraged students first entering the upper-division curriculum in Chemistry to seek out knowledge and rely on their foundational skills to develop protocols for various lab experiments. Removing the "rails" on which previous lab courses have been run often daunts the students at first, but I encouraged them to remember the ways in which they have performed experiments previously, and pushed them to hone their scientific writing skills.

# Graduate Teaching Assistant, Georgia Institute of Technology

## Undergraduate Minor in Astrobniology
At Georgia Institute of Technology. I began the process of creating an Undergraduate Minor in Astrobiology, modeled after the Graduate Certificate in Astrobiology already offered at Georgia Tech, an effort which I hope will improve interdisciplinary learning among students who began with an interest in one or a few of the many fields encompassed by Astrobiology.

## Tech to Teaching
I have completed the Tech to Teaching certificate program at Georgia Tech, including a Minor in Higher Education.

# Previous Teaching Assistant Work
2012–2013: "Climate Change" (University of Southern California)
Instructed a lab/project section involving multiple models and demonstrations involving climate change and its effects on the Earth today.

2017–2018: "Introduction to Quantitative Analysis" (Georgia Institute of Technology)
Supervised lab sections focused on the accurate measurement and statistical analysis of a variety of standard chemical experiments including titrations, gravimetric analysis, spectroscopic analysis, and more.

2021: "Survey of Biochemistry" (Georgia Institute of Technology)
Assisted instruction, held office hours, and wrote assessment content for an upper-level biochemistry course for undergraduate students.

# Outreach
As part of the Center for Chemical Evolution, I participated in such events as Buzz on Biotech, the Atlanta Science Festival, and STEAM night at Mableton Elementary School as a volunteer to manage and implement scientific demos for children and the general public.
