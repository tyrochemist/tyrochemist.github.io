                    I am a Visiting Assistant Professor at Trinity University, where I am currently teaching
                    Biochemistry. I previously completed my Ph.D. in Chemistry and Biochemistry in the
                    <a href="https://ww2.chemistry.gatech.edu/hud/home">Hud Lab</a> at Georgia Tech. As an academic, I
                    have been driven by my desire to understand life from first a biological, and then a chemical,
                    perspective. Both within and outside of science, I believe that to be challenged in one's beliefs is
                    to truly understand them, and I welcome open and honest discussion about any topic.
                    <br><br> My nickname "Tyro" is a shortening of my first and last name, but I've come to learn that
                    as a real word, "tyro" is of neoclassical origin, stemming from an alternate spelling of the latin
                    word "tiro", meaning recruit or learner.
                    In 1610, the iatrochemist Jean Beguin published what has been cited as the first chemistry textbook,
                    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyrocinium_Chymicum">Tyrocinium Chymicum</a>, cementing
                    the shift from alchemy to chemistry
                    in the sciences.
                    <br><br> I believe in the concept of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin">beginner's
                        mind</a> and strive to maintain such an attitude in my approach to learning about all topics,
                    both those which are new to me and those with which I am familiar. Here, I will try to cultivate my
                    own Tyrocinium, or place of learning, in all of my efforts.

                <p>
                    The chemistry that allows sugar formation and nucleobase glycosylation occurs under similar
                    conditions. To better understand the likelihood that these reactions could have occurred on the
                    early Earth, I am working toward recreating these key reactions in a single pot, without intervening
                    purification steps.

                        <a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/chem.202203036">A Plausible Prebiotic Path to Nucleosides:
                            Ribosides and Related Aldosides are Generated from Ribulose, Fructose, and Similar Abiotic
                            Precursors.</a></b>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The formation of sugars on the early Earth could have happened by a variety of processes beyond the
                    traditional formose reaction. Some of these reliably produce ketose sugars, which could have served
                    as a pool of stable sugars that could "leach" substrates for nucleobase capture via interconversion
                    to aldoses. In this way, nucleosides of glucose and ribose could have formed robustly on the early
                    Earth. For a video presentation on this topic, see <a
                        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xwOHUG1WSDc">this youtube video.</a>

                </p>
                <p>
                    Noncanonical nucleosides could have predated the traditional "RNA World" in chemical evolution, and
                    their formation could have occurred in a variety of ways. Importantly, divalent nucleosides are much
                    more likely to react with sugars in chemical contexts that preclude hydroxide as a nucleofuge.

                <h3>Teaching</h3>
                <h4>Visiting Assistant Professor of Chemistry</h4>
                <p>
                    I have taught two classes thus far at Trinity University, including Biochem I and Biochemistry
                    Laboratory.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Biochem I
                </h5>
                <p>
                    I have taught Biochem I in a flipped-classroom style, utilizing some previously-created videos and
                    some I made myself, in order to foster productive engagement during the class period. Complementing
                    the standard Biochemical curriculum, I included an emphasis on 3D-molecular visualization as well as
                    incorporating discussions about racism in science and medicine as provided by my co-teacher.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Biochemistry Lab
                </h5>
                <p>
                    I taught Biochemistry Laboratory collaboratively with a co-teacher, and provided students excellent
                    opportunities to experience a variety of experimemtal techniques including FRET, circular dichroism,
                    fluorescence spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, isoelectric focusing, SDS-PAGE, and column affinity
                    chromatography.
                </p>
                <h5>
                    Advanced Chemical Principles
                </h5>
                <p>
                    In this course, I encouraged students first entering the upper-division curriculum in Chemistry to
                    seek out knowledge and rely on their foundational skills to develop protocols for various lab
                    experiments. Removing the "rails" on which previous lab courses have been run often daunts the
                    students at first, but I encouraged them to remember the ways in which they have performed
                    experiments previously, and pushed them to hone their scientific writing skills.
                </p>
