I love to put both of them together!

Beyond that, there are a surprising number of similarities between DIY furniture and one of the most important molecules of life. It turns out that the same force that holds your furniture together is responsible for small, individual DNA pieces, or "bases", bonding together to form a strand of DNA. It also is necessary for two DNA strands to pair up with each other. The electromagnetic force, which involves the movement of the small, negatively-charged electrons, is the reason that all of these things occur.

But how do you put DNA together, and is the process anything like building furniture?

Fortunately for us, IKEA sends instruction manuals! But for life, DNA *is* the instruction manual for the rest of biology's components. It would be like if you needed to build a piece of furniture first to learn how to build the rest of your furniture! So how could DNA have come about without its own instruction manual?

Well, some research points towards the idea of self-assembly. The pieces and parts that make up DNA, or an older version of it, could have naturally found themselves in the right arrangement to assemble all by themselves in pools of water on the early Earth. Wouldn't it be nice if our furniture could do that?

My most recent project ([[One-Pot Formation of Pairing Proto-RNA Nucleotides]]) shows how we managed to find the possible conditions for these pieces of ancient DNA to self-assemble. There are two different bases, rather than the four present in modern DNA, which makes things slightly easierâ€”but we still had to ensure they could attach to their scaffold molecule, like pegs in the holes of your furniture before bringing two pieces together. We managed to see not only that they attached, but also, without any further help, that they then managed to self-assemble. 

Without the equivalent of an IKEA builder back on the early Earth, when life began to form, the chemical soup had to figure out its own instructions. This work sheds some light on how the building of the furniture of life began.
