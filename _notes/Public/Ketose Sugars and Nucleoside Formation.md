I'm excited to be able to show off my first 1st-author publication that builds heavily on the chemistry discussed in the review we published previously ([[Prebiotic Noncanonical Nucleoside Formation]]). This is the culmination of a project in which we were successfully able to generate ribonucleosides from ketose precursors, bypassing the traditional "formose reaction" problem. A summary:

> The formation of sugars on the early Earth could have happened by a variety of processes beyond the traditional formose reaction. Some of these reliably produce ketose sugars, which could have served as a pool of stable sugars that could "leach" substrates for nucleobase capture via interconversion to aldoses. In this way, nucleosides of glucose and ribose could have formed robustly on the early Earth. 

Check out the paper below for a detailed look:
